# credentials to login: (required because app is protected with authentication) => {
  to login as admin : [
    {
      email : michael@dundermifflin.com,
      password: Michael5
    },
    {
      email: david@dundermifflin.com,
      password: David7
    }
  ]
  to login as regular employee: [
     {
      email : jim@dundermifflin.com,
      password: Jim7
    },
    {
      email: pam@dundermifflin.com,
      password: Pam6
    }
  ]
} 

you can login as admin and create your own employee from the admin section and
can login using the email you specified and the password as 
mind the caps of name which you specify during form creation!
: const password = firstName + String(lastName.length);
// eg : Akshat Garg  => password = Akshat4
        AKSHAT Garg => password = AKSHAT4
        akshat Garg => password = akshat4
        Michael Scott => password = Michael5

        similarly you can find the password of all employee based on their name,
        from the search page.
